# FeatureTyping

`Features` package · concrete metaclass

FeatureTyping is Specialization in which the specific Type is a Feature. This means the set of instances of the (specific) typedFeature is a subset of the set of instances of the (general) type. In the simplest case, the type is a Classifier, whereupon the typedFeature has values that are instances of the Classifier.
