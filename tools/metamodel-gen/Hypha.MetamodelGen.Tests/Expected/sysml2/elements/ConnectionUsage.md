# ConnectionUsage

`Connections` package · concrete metaclass

A ConnectionUsage is a ConnectorAsUsage that is also a PartUsage. Nominally, if its type is a ConnectionDefinition, then a ConnectionUsage is a Usage of that ConnectionDefinition, representing a connection between parts of a system. However, other kinds of kernel AssociationStructures are also allowed, to permit use of AssociationStructures from the Kernel Model Libraries.
