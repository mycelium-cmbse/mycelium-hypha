## Constraints

### checkCaseUsageSpecialization

A CaseUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the base CaseUsage Cases::cases from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Cases::cases')
```

### checkCaseUsageSubcaseSpecialization

A composite CaseUsage whose owningType is a CaseDefinition or CaseUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the CaseUsage Cases::Case::subcases.

```ocl
isComposite and owningType <> null and 
    (owningType.oclIsKindOf(CaseDefinition) or
     owningType.oclIsKindOf(CaseUsage)) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Cases::Case::subcases')
```

### deriveCaseUsageActorParameter

The actorParameters of a CaseUsage are the ownedActorParameters of the ActorMemberships of the CaseUsage.

```ocl
actorParameter = featureMembership->
    selectByKind(ActorMembership).
    ownedActorParameter
```

### deriveCaseUsageObjectiveRequirement

The objectiveRequirement of a CaseUsage is the RequirementUsage it owns via an <case>ObjectiveMembership, if any.</case>

```ocl
objectiveRequirement = 
    let objectives: OrderedSet(RequirementUsage) = 
        featureMembership->
            selectByKind(ObjectiveMembership).
            ownedRequirement in
    if objectives->isEmpty() then null
    else objectives->first().ownedObjectiveRequirement
    endif
```

### deriveCaseUsageSubjectParameter

The subjectParameter of a CaseUsage is the ownedSubjectParameter of its SubjectMembership (if any).

```ocl
subjectParameter =
    let subjects : OrderedSet(SubjectMembership) = 
        featureMembership->selectByKind(SubjectMembership) in
    if subjects->isEmpty() then null
    else subjects->first().ownedSubjectParameter
    endif
```

### validateCaseUsageOnlyOneObjective

A CaseUsage must have at most one featureMembership that is a ObjectiveMembership.

```ocl
featureMembership->
    selectByKind(ObjectiveMembership)->
    size() <= 1
```

### validateCaseUsageOnlyOneSubject

A CaseUsage must have at most one featureMembership that is a SubjectMembership.

```ocl
featureMembership->
	selectByKind(SubjectMembership)->
	size() <= 1
```

### validateCaseUsageSubjectParameterPosition

The subjectParameter of a CaseUsage must be its first input.

```ocl
input->notEmpty() and input->first() = subjectParameter
```
