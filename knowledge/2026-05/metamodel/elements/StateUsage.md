# StateUsage

`States` package · concrete metaclass

A StateUsage is an ActionUsage that is nominally the Usage of a StateDefinition. However, other kinds of kernel Behaviors are also allowed as types, to permit use of BehaviorsA StateUsage may be related to up to three of its ownedFeatures by StateSubactionMembership Relationships, all of different kinds, corresponding to the entry, do and exit actions of the StateUsage.

## Owned features

### doAction

`+` [ActionUsage](ActionUsage.md) · `[0..1]` · *derived*

The ActionUsage of this StateUsage to be performed while in the state defined by the StateDefinition. It is the owned ActionUsage related to the StateUsage by a StateSubactionMembership with kind = do.

### entryAction

`+` [ActionUsage](ActionUsage.md) · `[0..1]` · *derived*

The ActionUsage of this StateUsage to be performed on entry to the state defined by the StateDefinition. It is the owned ActionUsage related to the StateUsage by a StateSubactionMembership with kind = entry.

### exitAction

`+` [ActionUsage](ActionUsage.md) · `[0..1]` · *derived*

The ActionUsage of this StateUsage to be performed on exit to the state defined by the StateDefinition. It is the owned ActionUsage related to the StateUsage by a StateSubactionMembership with kind = exit.

### isParallel

`+` [Boolean](Boolean.md) · `[1..1]`

Whether the nestedStates of this StateUsage are to all be performed in parallel. If true, none of the nestedActions (which include nestedStates) may have any incoming or outgoing Transitions. If false, only one nestedState may be performed at a time.

### stateDefinition

`+` [Behavior](Behavior.md) · `[0..*]` · *derived, ordered*

The Behaviors that are the types of this StateUsage. Nominally, these would be StateDefinitions, but kernel Behaviors are also allowed, to permit use of Behaviors from the Kernel Model Libraries.

## Constraints

### checkStateUsageExclusiveStateSpecialization

A StateUsage that is a substate usage with a non-parallel owning StateDefinition or StateUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the StateUsage States::StateAction::exclusiveStates from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
isSubstateUsage(false) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('States::StateAction::exclusiveStates')
```

### checkStateUsageOwnedStateSpecialization

A composite StateUsage whose owningType is a PartDefinition or PartUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the StateUsage Parts::Part::ownedStates from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
isComposite and owningType <> null and
(owningType.oclIsKindOf(PartDefinition) or
 owningType.oclIsKindOf(PartUsage)) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Parts::Part::ownedStates')
```

### checkStateUsageSpecialization

A StateUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the StateUsage States::stateActions from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('States::stateActions')
```

### checkStateUsageSubstateSpecialization

A StateUsage that is a substate usage with a owning StateDefinition or StateUsage that is parallel must directly or indirectly specialize the StateUsage States::StateAction::substates from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
isSubstateUsage(true) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('States::StateAction::substates')
```

### deriveStateUsageDoAction

The doAction of a StateUsage is the action of the owned StateSubactionMembership with kind = do.

```ocl
doAction =
    let doMemberships : Sequence(StateSubactionMembership) =
        ownedMembership->
            selectByKind(StateSubactionMembership)->
            select(kind = StateSubactionKind::do) in
    if doMemberships->isEmpty() then null
    else doMemberships->at(1)
    endif
```

### deriveStateUsageEntryAction

The entryAction of a StateUsage is the action of the owned StateSubactionMembership with kind = entry.

```ocl
entryAction =
    let entryMemberships : Sequence(StateSubactionMembership) =
        ownedMembership->
            selectByKind(StateSubactionMembership)->
            select(kind = StateSubactionKind::entry) in
    if entryMemberships->isEmpty() then null
    else entryMemberships->at(1)
    endif
```

### deriveStateUsageExitAction

The exitAction of a StateUsage is the action of the owned StateSubactionMembership with kind = exit.

```ocl
exitAction =
    let exitMemberships : Sequence(StateSubactionMembership) =
        ownedMembership->
            selectByKind(StateSubactionMembership)->
            select(kind = StateSubactionKind::exit) in
    if exitMemberships->isEmpty() then null
    else exitMemberships->at(1)
    endif
```

### validateStateUsageParallelSubactions

If a StateUsage is parallel, then its nestedActions (which includes nestedStates) must not have any incomingTransitions or outgoingTransitions.

```ocl
isParallel implies
    nestedAction.incomingTransition->isEmpty() and
    nestedAction.outgoingTransition->isEmpty()
```

### validateStateUsageStateSubactionKind

A StateUsage must not have more than one owned StateSubactionMembership of each kind.

```ocl
ownedMembership->
    selectByKind(StateSubactionMembership)->
    isUnique(kind)
```
