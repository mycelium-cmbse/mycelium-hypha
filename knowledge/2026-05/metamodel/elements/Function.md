# Function

`Functions` package · concrete metaclass

A Function is a Behavior that has an out parameter that is identified as its result. A Function represents the performance of a calculation that produces the values of its result parameter. This calculation may be decomposed into Expressions that are steps of the Function.

## Generalizations

- [Behavior](Behavior.md)

## Specializations

- [CalculationDefinition](CalculationDefinition.md)
- [Predicate](Predicate.md)

## Owned features

### expression

`+` [Expression](Expression.md) · `[0..*]` · *derived*

The Expressions that are steps in the calculation of the result of this Function.

Subsets [step](Behavior.md#step)

### isModelLevelEvaluable

`+` [Boolean](Boolean.md) · `[1..1]` · *derived*

Whether this Function can be used as the function of a model-level evaluable InvocationExpression. Certain Functions from the Kernel Functions Library are considered to have isModelLevelEvaluable = true. For all other Functions it is false.<strong>Note:</strong> See the specification of the KerML concrete syntax notation for Expressions for an identification of which library Functions are model-level evaluable.

### result

`+` [Feature](Feature.md) · `[1..1]` · *derived*

The object or value that is the result of evaluating the Function.

Subsets [output](Type.md#output), [parameter](Behavior.md#parameter)

## Constraints

### checkFunctionResultBindingConnector

If a Function has an Expression owned via a ResultExpressionMembership, then the owning Function must also own a BindingConnector between its result parameter and the result parameter of the result Expression.

```ocl
ownedMembership.selectByKind(ResultExpressionMembership)->
    forAll(mem | ownedFeature.selectByKind(BindingConnector)->
        exists(binding |
            binding.relatedFeature->includes(result) and
            binding.relatedFeature->includes(mem.ownedResultExpression.result)))
```

### checkFunctionSpecialization

A Function must directly or indirectly specialize the base Function Performances::Evaluation from the Kernel Semantic Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Performances::Evaluation')
```

### deriveFunctionResult

The result parameter of a Function is its parameter owned (possibly in a supertype) via a ReturnParameterMembership (if any).

```ocl
result =
    let resultParams : Sequence(Feature) =
        featureMemberships->
            selectByKind(ReturnParameterMembership).
            ownedMemberParameter in
    if resultParams->notEmpty() then resultParams->first()
    else null
    endif
```

### validateFunctionResultExpressionMembership

A Function must have at most one ResultExpressionMembership.

```ocl
membership->selectByKind(ResultExpressionMembership)->size() <= 1
```

### validateFunctionResultParameterMembership

A Function must have exactly one featureMembership (owned or inherited) that is a ResultParameterMembership.

```ocl
featureMembership->
    selectByKind(ReturnParameterMembership)->
    size() = 1
```
