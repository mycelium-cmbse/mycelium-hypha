- [Expression](Expression.md)

## Owned features

### referent : Feature [1..1] {derived}

## Constraints

### checkFeatureReferenceExpressionBindingConnector

A FeatureReferenceExpression must have an ownedMember that is a BindingConnector between the referent and result of the FeatureReferenceExpression.

```ocl
ownedMember->selectByKind(BindingConnector)->exists(b |
    b.relatedFeatures->includes(targetFeature) and
    b.relatedFeatures->includes(result))
```

### checkFeatureReferenceExpressionResultSpecialization

The result parameter of a FeatureReferenceExpression must specialize the referent of the FeatureReferenceExpression.

```ocl
result.owningType() = self and result.specializes(referent)
```

### deriveFeatureReferenceExpressionReferent

The referent of a FeatureReferenceExpression is the memberElement of its first ownedMembership that is not a ParameterMembership.

```ocl
referent =
    let nonParameterMemberships : Sequence(Membership) = ownedMembership->
        reject(oclIsKindOf(ParameterMembership)) in
    if nonParameterMemberships->isEmpty() or
       not nonParameterMemberships->first().memberElement.oclIsKindOf(Feature)
    then null
    else nonParameterMemberships->first().memberElement.oclAsType(Feature)
    endif
```

### validateFeatureReferenceExpressionReferentIsFeature

The first ownedMembership of a FeatureReferenceExpression that is not a ParameterMembership must have a Feature as its memberElement.

```ocl
let membership : Membership = 
    ownedMembership->reject(m | m.oclIsKindOf(ParameterMembership)) in
membership->notEmpty() and
membership->at(1).memberElement.oclIsKindOf(Feature)
```

### validateFeatureReferenceExpressionResult

A FeatureReferenceExpression must own its result parameter.

```ocl
result.owningType = self
```
