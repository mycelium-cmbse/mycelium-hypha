# AllocationDefinition

`Allocations` package · concrete metaclass

An AllocationDefinition is a ConnectionDefinition that specifies that some or all of the responsibility to realize the intent of the source is allocated to the target instances. Such allocations define mappings across the various structures and hierarchies of a system model, perhaps as a precursor to more rigorous specifications and implementations. An AllocationDefinition can itself be refined using nested allocations that give a finer-grained decomposition of the containing allocation mapping.

## Constraints

### checkAllocationDefinitionSpecialization

An AllocationDefinition must directly or indirectly specialize the AllocationDefinition Allocations::Allocation from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Allocations::Allocation')
```

### deriveAllocationDefinitionAllocation

The allocations of an AllocationDefinition are all its usages that are AllocationUsages.

```ocl
allocation = usage->selectAsKind(AllocationUsage)
```
