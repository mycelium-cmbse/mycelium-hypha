# Classifier

`Classifiers` package · concrete metaclass

A Classifier is a Type that classifies:<ul> <li>Things (in the universe) regardless of how Features relate them. (These are interpreted semantically as sequences of exactly one thing.)</li> <li>How the above things are related by Features. (These are interpreted semantically as sequences of multiple things, such that the last thing in the sequence is also classified by the Classifier. Note that this means that a Classifier modeled as specializing a Feature cannot classify anything.)</li></ul>

## Constraints

### deriveClassifierOwnedSubclassification

The ownedSubclassifications of a Classifier are its ownedSpecializations that are Subclassifications.

```ocl
ownedSubclassification = 
    ownedSpecialization->selectByKind(Subclassification)
```

### validateClassifierMultiplicityDomain

If a Classifier has a multiplicity, then the multiplicity must have no featuringTypes (meaning that its domain is implicitly Base::Anything).

```ocl
multiplicity <> null implies multiplicity.featuringType->isEmpty()
```
