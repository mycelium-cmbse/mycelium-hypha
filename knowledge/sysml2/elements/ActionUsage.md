# ActionUsage

`Actions` package · concrete metaclass

An ActionUsage is a Usage that is also a Step, and, so, is typed by a Behavior. Nominally, if the type is an ActionDefinition, an ActionUsage is a Usage of that ActionDefinition within a system. However, other kinds of kernel Behaviors are also allowed, to permit use of Behaviors from the Kernel Model Libraries.

## Constraints

### checkActionUsageOwnedActionSpecialization

A composite ActionUsage whose owningType is PartDefinition or PartUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the ActionUsage Parts::Part::ownedActions from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
isComposite and owningType <> null and
(owningType.oclIsKindOf(PartDefinition) or
 owningType.oclIsKindOf(PartUsage)) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Parts::Part::ownedActions')
```

### checkActionUsageSpecialization

An ActionUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the ActionUsage Actions::actions from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Actions::actions')
```

### checkActionUsageStateActionRedefinition

An ActionUsage that is the entry, do, or exit Action of a StateDefinition or StateUsage must redefine the entryAction, doAction, or exitAction feature, respectively, of the StateDefinition States::StateAction from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
owningFeatureMembership <> null and
owningFeatureMembership.oclIsKindOf(StateSubactionMembership) implies
    let kind : StateSubactionKind = 
        owningFeatureMembership.oclAsType(StateSubactionMembership).kind in
    if kind = StateSubactionKind::entry then
        redefinesFromLibrary('States::StateAction::entryAction')
    else if kind = StateSubactionKind::do then
        redefinesFromLibrary('States::StateAction::doAction')
    else
        redefinesFromLibrary('States::StateAction::exitAction')
    endif endif
```

### checkActionUsageSubactionSpecialization

A composite ActionUsage that is a subaction usage must directly or indirectly specialize the ActionUsage Actions::Action::subactions from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
isSubactionUsage() implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Actions::Action::subactions')
```
