# ConstraintUsage

`Constraints` package · concrete metaclass

A ConstraintUsage is an OccurrenceUsage that is also a BooleanExpression, and, so, is typed by a Predicate. Nominally, if the type is a ConstraintDefinition, a ConstraintUsage is a Usage of that ConstraintDefinition. However, other kinds of kernel Predicates are also allowed, to permit use of Predicates from the Kernel Model Libraries.

## Generalizations

- [OccurrenceUsage](OccurrenceUsage.md)

## Specializations

## Owned features

### constraintDefinition

`+` [Predicate](Predicate.md) · `[0..1]` · *derived*

The (single) Predicate that is the type of this ConstraintUsage. Nominally, this will be a ConstraintDefinition, but other kinds of Predicates are also allowed, to permit use of Predicates from the Kernel Model Libraries.

## Constraints

### checkConstraintUsageCheckedConstraintSpecialization

A ConstraintUsage whose owningType is an ItemDefinition or ItemUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the ConstraintUsage Items::Item::checkedConstraints.

```ocl
owningType <> null and
(owningType.oclIsKindOf(ItemDefinition) or
 owningType.oclIsKindOf(ItemUsage)) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Items::Item::checkedConstraints')
```

### checkConstraintUsageRequirementConstraintSpecialization

A composite ConstraintUsage whose owningFeatureMembership is a RequirementConstraintMembership must directly or indirectly specialize on the ConstraintUsages assumptions or constraints from the ConstraintDefinition Requirements::RequirementCheck in the Systems Model Library, depending on whether the kind of the RequirementConstraintMembership is assumption or requirement, respectively.

```ocl
isComposite and
owningFeatureMembership <> null and
owningFeatureMembership.oclIsKindOf(RequirementConstraintMembership) implies
    if owningFeatureMembership.oclAsType(RequirementConstraintMembership).kind = 
        RequirementConstraintKind::assumption then
        specializesFromLibrary('Requirements::RequirementCheck::assumptions')
    else
        specializesFromLibrary('Requirements::RequirementCheck::constraints')
    endif
```

### checkConstraintUsageSpecialization

A ConstraintUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the base ConstraintUsage Constraints::constraintChecks from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Constraints::constraintChecks')
```
