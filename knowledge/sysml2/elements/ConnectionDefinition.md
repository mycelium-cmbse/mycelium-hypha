# ConnectionDefinition

`Connections` package · concrete metaclass

A ConnectionDefinition is a PartDefinition that is also an AssociationStructure. The end Features of a ConnectionDefinition must be Usages.

## Generalizations

- [AssociationStructure](AssociationStructure.md)
- [PartDefinition](PartDefinition.md)

## Specializations

- [AllocationDefinition](AllocationDefinition.md)
- [InterfaceDefinition](InterfaceDefinition.md)

## Owned features

### connectionEnd

`+` [Usage](Usage.md) · `[0..*]` · *derived, ordered*

The Usages that define the things related by the ConnectionDefinition.

Redefines [associationEnd](Association.md#associationend)

### isSufficient

`+` Boolean · `[1..1]`

A ConnectionDefinition always has isSufficient = true.
