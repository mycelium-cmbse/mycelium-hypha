# Expression

`Functions` package · concrete metaclass

An Expression is a Step that is typed by a Function. An Expression that also has a Function as its featuringType is a computational step within that Function. An Expression always has a single result parameter, which redefines the result parameter of its defining function. This allows Expressions to be interconnected in tree structures, in which inputs to each Expression in the tree are determined as the results of other Expression in the tree.

## Owned features

### function : Function [0..1] {derived}

The Function that types this Expression.

Redefines: `behavior`

### isModelLevelEvaluable : Boolean [1..1] {derived}

Whether this Expression meets the constraints necessary to be evaluated at model level, that is, using metadata within the model.

### result : Feature [1..1] {derived}

An output parameter of the Expression whose value is the result of the Expression. The result of an Expression is either inherited from its function or it is related to the Expression via a ReturnParameterMembership, in which case it redefines the result parameter of its function.

Subsets: `output`, `parameter`

## Constraints

### checkExpressionResultBindingConnector

If an Expression has an Expression owned via a ResultExpressionMembership, then the owning Expression must also own a BindingConnector between its result parameter and the result parameter of the result Expression.

```ocl
ownedMembership.selectByKind(ResultExpressionMembership)->
    forAll(mem | ownedFeature.selectByKind(BindingConnector)->
        exists(binding |
            binding.relatedFeature->includes(result) and
            binding.relatedFeature->includes(mem.ownedResultExpression.result)))
```

### checkExpressionSpecialization

An Expression must directly or indirectly specialize the base Expression Performances::evaluations from the Kernel Semantic Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Performances::evaluations')
```

### checkExpressionTypeFeaturing

If this Expression is owned by a FeatureValue, then it must have the same featuringTypes as the featureWithValue of the FeatureValue.

```ocl
owningMembership <> null and 
owningMembership.oclIsKindOf(FeatureValue) implies
    let featureWithValue : Feature = 
        owningMembership.oclAsType(FeatureValue).featureWithValue in
    featuringType = featureWithValue.featuringType
```

### deriveExpressionIsModelLevelEvaluable

Whether an Expression isModelLevelEvaluable is determined by the modelLevelEvaluable() operation.

```ocl
isModelLevelEvaluable = modelLevelEvaluable(Set(Element){})
```

### deriveExpressionResult

The result parameter of an Expression is its parameter owned (possibly in a supertype) via a ReturnParameterMembership (if any).

```ocl
result =
    let resultParams : Sequence(Feature) =
        featureMemberships->
            selectByKind(ReturnParameterMembership).
            ownedMemberParameter in
    if resultParams->notEmpty() then resultParams->first()
    else null
    endif
```

### validateExpressionResultExpressionMembership

An Expression must have at most one ResultExpressionMembership.

```ocl
membership->selectByKind(ResultExpressionMembership)->size() <= 1
```

### validateExpressionResultParameterMembership

An Expression must have exactly one featureMembership (owned or inherited) that is a ResultParameterMembership.

```ocl
featureMembership->
    selectByKind(ReturnParameterMembership)->
    size() = 1
```
