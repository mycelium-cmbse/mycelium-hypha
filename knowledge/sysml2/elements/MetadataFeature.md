# MetadataFeature

`Metadata` package · concrete metaclass

A MetadataFeature is a Feature that is an AnnotatingElement used to annotate another Element with metadata. It is typed by a Metaclass. All its ownedFeatures must redefine features of its metaclass and any feature bindings must be model-level evaluable.

## Generalizations

## Owned features

### metaclass : Metaclass [0..1] {derived}

## Constraints

### checkMetadataFeatureSemanticSpecialization

If this MetadataFeature is an application of SemanticMetadata, then its annotatingElement must be a Type. The annotated Type must then directly or indirectly specialize the specified value of the baseType, unless the Type is a Classifier and the baseType represents a kind of Feature, in which case the Classifier must directly or indirectly specialize each of the types of the Feature.

```ocl
isSemantic() implies
    let annotatedTypes : Sequence(Type) = 
        annotatedElement->selectAsKind(Type) in
    let baseTypes : Sequence(MetadataFeature) = 
        evaluateFeature(resolveGlobal(
            'Metaobjects::SemanticMetadata::baseType').
            memberElement.
            oclAsType(Feature))->
        selectAsKind(MetadataFeature) in
    annotatedTypes->notEmpty() and 
    baseTypes()->notEmpty() and 
    baseTypes()->first().isSyntactic() implies
        let annotatedType : Type = annotatedTypes->first() in
        let baseType : Element = baseTypes->first().syntaxElement() in
        if annotatedType.oclIsKindOf(Classifier) and 
            baseType.oclIsKindOf(Feature) then
            baseType.oclAsType(Feature).type->
                forAll(t | annotatedType.specializes(t))
        else if baseType.oclIsKindOf(Type) then
            annotatedType.specializes(baseType.oclAsType(Type))
        else
            true
        endif
```

### checkMetadataFeatureSpecialization

A MetadataFeature must directly or indirectly specialize the base MetadataFeature Metaobjects::metaobjects from the Kernel Semantic Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Metaobjects::metaobjects')
```

### deriveMetadataFeatureMetaclass

The metaclass of a MetadataFeature is one of its types that is a Metaclass.

```ocl
metaclass = 
    let metaclassTypes : Sequence(Type) = type->selectByKind(Metaclass) in
    if metaclassTypes->isEmpty() then null
    else metaClassTypes->first()
    endif
```

### validateMetadataFeatureAnnotatedElement

The annotatedElements of a MetadataFeature must have an abstract syntax metaclass consistent with the annotatedElement declarations for the MetadataFeature.

```ocl
let baseAnnotatedElementFeature : Feature =
    resolveGlobal('Metaobjects::Metaobject::annotatedElement').memberElement.
    oclAsType(Feature) in
let annotatedElementFeatures : OrderedSet(Feature) = feature->
    select(specializes(baseAnnotatedElementFeature))->
    excluding(baseAnnotatedElementFeature) in
annotatedElementFeatures->notEmpty() implies
    let annotatedElementTypes : Set(Feature) =
        annotatedElementFeatures.typing.type->asSet() in
    let metaclasses : Set(Metaclass) =
        annotatedElement.oclType().qualifiedName->collect(qn | 
            resolveGlobal(qn).memberElement.oclAsType(Metaclass)) in
   metaclasses->forAll(m | annotatedElementTypes->exists(t | m.specializes(t)))
```

### validateMetadataFeatureBody

Each ownedFeature of a MetadataFeature must have no declared name, redefine a single Feature, either have no featureValue or a featureValue with a value Expression that is model-level evaluable, and only have ownedFeatures that also meet these restrictions.

```ocl
ownedFeature->closure(ownedFeature)->forAll(f |
    f.declaredName = null and f.declaredShortName = null and
    f.valuation <> null implies f.valuation.value.isModelLevelEvaluable and
    f.redefinition.redefinedFeature->size() = 1)
```

### validateMetadataFeatureMetaclass

A MetadataFeature must have exactly one type that is a Metaclass.

```ocl
type->selectByKind(Metaclass).size() = 1
```

### validateMetadataFeatureMetaclassNotAbstract

The metaclass of a MetadataFeature must not be abstract.

```ocl
not metaclass.isAbstract
```
