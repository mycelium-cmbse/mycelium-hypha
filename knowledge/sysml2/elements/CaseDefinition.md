## Constraints

### checkCaseDefinitionSpecialization

A CaseDefinition must directly or indirectly specialize the base CaseDefinition Cases::Case> from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Cases::Case')
```

### deriveCaseDefinitionActorParameter

The actorParameters of a CaseDefinition are the ownedActorParameters of the ActorMemberships of the CaseDefinition.

```ocl
actorParameter = featureMembership->
    selectByKind(ActorMembership).
    ownedActorParameter
```

### deriveCaseDefinitionObjectiveRequirement

The objectiveRequirement of a CaseDefinition is the ownedObjectiveRequirement of its <case>ObjectiveMembership, if any.</case>

```ocl
objectiveRequirement = 
    let objectives: OrderedSet(RequirementUsage) = 
        featureMembership->
            selectByKind(ObjectiveMembership).
            ownedRequirement in
    if objectives->isEmpty() then null
    else objectives->first().ownedObjectiveRequirement
    endif
```

### deriveCaseDefinitionSubjectParameter

The subjectParameter of a CaseDefinition is the ownedSubjectParameter of its SubjectMembership (if any).

```ocl
subjectParameter =
    let subjectMems : OrderedSet(SubjectMembership) = 
        featureMembership->selectByKind(SubjectMembership) in
    if subjectMems->isEmpty() then null
    else subjectMems->first().ownedSubjectParameter
    endif
```

### validateCaseDefinitionOnlyOneObjective

A CaseDefinition must have at most one featureMembership that is a ObjectiveMembership.

```ocl
featureMembership->
    selectByKind(ObjectiveMembership)->
    size() <= 1
```

### validateCaseDefinitionOnlyOneSubject

A CaseDefinition must have at most one featureMembership that is a SubjectMembership.

```ocl
featureMembership->selectByKind(SubjectMembership)->size() <= 1
```

### validateCaseDefinitionSubjectParameterPosition

The subjectParameter of a CaaseDefinition must be its first input.

```ocl
input->notEmpty() and input->first() = subjectParameter
```
