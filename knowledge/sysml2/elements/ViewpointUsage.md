## Constraints

### checkViewpointUsageSpecialization

A ViewpointUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the base ViewpointUsage Views::viewpointChecks from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Views::viewpointChecks')
```

### checkViewpointUsageViewpointSatisfactionSpecialization

A composite ViewpointUsage whose owningType is a ViewDefinition or ViewUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the ViewpointUsage Views::View::viewpointSatisfactions from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
isComposite and owningType <> null and
(owningType.oclIsKindOf(ViewDefinition) or
 owningType.oclIsKindOf(ViewUsage)) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Views::View::viewpointSatisfactions')
```

### deriveViewpointUsageViewpointStakeholder

The viewpointStakeholders of a ViewpointUsage are the ownedStakeholderParameters of all featureMemberships that are StakeholderMemberships.

```ocl
viewpointStakeholder = framedConcern.featureMemberhsip->
    selectByKind(StakeholderMembership).
    ownedStakeholderParameter
```
