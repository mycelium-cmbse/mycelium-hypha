# FeatureInverting

`Features` package · concrete metaclass

A FeatureInverting is a Relationship between Features asserting that their interpretations (sequences) are the reverse of each other, identified as featureInverted and invertingFeature. For example, a Feature identifying each person&#39;s parents is the inverse of a Feature identifying each person&#39;s children. A person identified as a parent of another will identify that other as one of their children.
