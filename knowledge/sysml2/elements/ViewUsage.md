# ViewUsage

`Views` package · concrete metaclass

A ViewUsage is a usage of a ViewDefinition to specify the generation of a view of the members of a collection of exposedNamespaces. The ViewUsage can satisfy more viewpoints than its definition, and it can specialize the viewRendering specified by its definition.

## Generalizations

- [PartUsage](PartUsage.md)

## Owned features

### exposedElement

`+` [Element](Element.md) · `[0..*]` · *derived, ordered*

The Elements that are exposed by this ViewUsage, which are those memberElements of the imported Memberships from all the Expose Relationships that meet all the owned and inherited viewConditions.

Subsets [member](Namespace.md#member)

### satisfiedViewpoint

`+` [ViewpointUsage](ViewpointUsage.md) · `[0..*]` · *derived, ordered*

The nestedRequirements of this ViewUsage that are ViewpointUsages for (additional) viewpoints satisfied by the ViewUsage.

Subsets [nestedRequirement](Usage.md#nestedrequirement)

### viewCondition

`+` [Expression](Expression.md) · `[0..*]` · *derived, ordered*

The Expressions related to this ViewUsage by ElementFilterMemberships, which specify conditions on Elements to be rendered in a view.

Subsets [ownedMember](Namespace.md#ownedmember)

### viewDefinition

`+` [ViewDefinition](ViewDefinition.md) · `[0..1]` · *derived*

The ViewDefinition that is the definition of this ViewUsage.

Redefines [partDefinition](PartUsage.md#partdefinition)

### viewRendering

`+` [RenderingUsage](RenderingUsage.md) · `[0..1]` · *derived*

The RenderingUsage to be used to render views defined by this ViewUsage, which is the referencedRendering of the ViewRenderingMembership of the ViewUsage.

## Constraints

### checkViewUsageSpecialization

A ViewUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the base ViewUsage Views::views from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Views::views')
```

### checkViewUsageSubviewSpecialization

A ViewUsage whose owningType is a ViewDefinition or ViewUsage must specialize the ViewUsage Views::View::subviews from the Systems Library Model.

```ocl
owningType <> null and
(owningType.oclIsKindOf(ViewDefinition) or
 owningType.oclIsKindOf(ViewUsage)) implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Views::View::subviews')
```

### deriveViewUsageExposedElement

The exposedElements of a ViewUsage are those memberElements of the imported Memberships from all the Expose Relationships for which the includeAsExposed operation returns true.

```ocl
exposedElement = ownedImport->selectByKind(Expose).
    importedMemberships(Set{}).memberElement->
    select(elm | includeAsExposed(elm))->
    asOrderedSet()
```

### deriveViewUsageSatisfiedViewpoint

The satisfiedViewpoints of a ViewUsage are its ownedRequirements that are composite ViewpointUsages.

```ocl
satisfiedViewpoint = ownedRequirement->
    selectByKind(ViewpointUsage)->
    select(isComposite)
```

### deriveViewUsageViewCondition

The viewConditions of a ViewUsage are the conditions of its owned ElementFilterMemberships.

```ocl
viewCondition = ownedMembership->
    selectByKind(ElementFilterMembership).
    condition
```

### deriveViewUsageViewRendering

The viewRendering of a ViewUsage is the referencedRendering of its owned ViewRenderingMembership, if any.

```ocl
viewRendering =
    let renderings: OrderedSet(ViewRenderingMembership) =
        featureMembership->selectByKind(ViewRenderingMembership) in
    if renderings->isEmpty() then null
    else renderings->first().referencedRendering
    endif
```

### validateViewUsageOnlyOneViewRendering

A ViewUsage must have at most one ViewRenderingMembership.

```ocl
featureMembership->
    selectByKind(ViewRenderingMembership)->
    size() <= 1
```
