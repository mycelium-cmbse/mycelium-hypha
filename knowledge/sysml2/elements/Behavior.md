# Behavior

`Behaviors` package · concrete metaclass

A Behavior coordinates occurrences of other Behaviors, as well as changes in objects. Behaviors can be decomposed into Steps and be characterized by parameters.

## Generalizations

- [Class](Class.md)

## Specializations

- [ActionDefinition](ActionDefinition.md)
- [Function](Function.md)
- [Interaction](Interaction.md)

## Owned features

### parameter : Feature [0..*] {derived, ordered}

The parameters of this Behavior, which are defined as its directedFeatures, whose values are passed into and/or out of a performance of the Behavior.

Redefines: `directedFeature`

### step : Step [0..*] {derived}

The Steps that make up this Behavior.

Subsets: `feature`

## Constraints

### checkBehaviorSpecialization

A Behavior must directly or indirectly specialize the base Behavior Performances::Performance from the Kernel Semantic Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Performances::Performance')
```

### deriveBehaviorStep

The steps of a Behavior are its features that are Steps.

```ocl
step = feature->selectByKind(Step)
```

### validateBehaviorSpecialization

A Behavior must not specialize a Structure.

```ocl
ownedSpecialization.general->forAll(not oclIsKindOf(Structure))
```
