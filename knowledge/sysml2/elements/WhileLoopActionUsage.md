# WhileLoopActionUsage

`Actions` package · concrete metaclass

A WhileLoopActionUsage is a LoopActionUsage that specifies that the bodyAction ActionUsage should be performed repeatedly while the result of the whileArgument Expression is true or until the result of the untilArgument Expression (if provided) is true. The whileArgument Expression is evaluated before each (possible) performance of the bodyAction, and the untilArgument Expression is evaluated after each performance of the bodyAction.

## Generalizations

- [LoopActionUsage](LoopActionUsage.md)

## Owned features

### untilArgument : Expression [0..1] {derived}

The Expression whose result, if false, determines that the bodyAction should continue to be performed. It is the (optional) third owned parameter of the WhileLoopActionUsage.

### whileArgument : Expression [1..1] {derived}

The Expression whose result, if true, determines that the bodyAction should continue to be performed. It is the first owned parameter of the WhileLoopActionUsage.

## Constraints

### checkWhileLoopActionUsageSpecialization

A WhileLoopActionUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the ActionUsage Actions::whileLoopActions from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Actions::whileLoopActions')
```

### checkWhileLoopActionUsageSubactionSpecialization

A composite WhileLoopActionUsage that is a subaction usage must directly or indirectly specialize the ActionUsage Actions::Action::whileLoops from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
isSubactionUsage() implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Actions::Action::whileLoops')
```

### deriveWhileLoopActionUsageUntilArgument

The whileArgument of a WhileLoopActionUsage is its third input parameter, which, if it exists, must be an Expression.

```ocl
untilArgument =
    let parameter : Feature = inputParameter(3) in
    if parameter <> null and parameter.oclIsKindOf(Expression) then
        parameter.oclAsType(Expression)
    else
        null
    endif
```

### deriveWhileLoopActionUsageWhileArgument

The whileArgument of a WhileLoopActionUsage is its first input parameter, which must be an Expression.

```ocl
whileArgument =
    let parameter : Feature = inputParameter(1) in
    if parameter <> null and parameter.oclIsKindOf(Expression) then
        parameter.oclAsType(Expression)
    else
        null
    endif
```

### validateWhileLoopActionUsage

A WhileLoopActionUsage must have at least two owned input parameters.

```ocl
inputParameters()->size() >= 2
```
