## Constraints

### checkFlowUsageFlowSpecialization

If a FlowUsage has ownedEndFeatures, it must directly or indirectly specialize the FlowUsage Flows::flows from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
ownedEndFeatures->notEmpty() implies
    specializesFromLibrary('Flows::flows')
```

### checkFlowUsageSpecialization

A FlowUsage must directly or indirectly specialize the base FlowUsage Flows::messages from the Systems Library model.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Flows::messages')
```
