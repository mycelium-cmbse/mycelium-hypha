## Constraints

### checkViewpointDefinitionSpecialization

A ViewpointDefinition must directly or indirectly specialize the base ViewpointDefinition Views::ViewpointCheck from the Systems Model Library.

```ocl
specializesFromLibrary('Views::ViewpointCheck')
```

### deriveViewpointDefinitionViewpointStakeholder

The viewpointStakeholders of a ViewpointDefinition are the ownedStakeholderParameters of all featureMemberships that are StakeholderMemberships.

```ocl
viewpointStakeholder = framedConcern.featureMemberhsip->
    selectByKind(StakeholderMembership).
    ownedStakeholderParameter
```
